# Page Fault Algorithms README #

  Part of an operating systems job is to swap in pages of memory from the disk to main memory.  
  This program compares the performance of different page replacement algorithms.  The optimal algorithm looks into the future to make the perfect swapping selections.  Although this can't be done in practice since the future may be unknown, it still acts as a good benchmark for algorithms that look in to the past (like LRU).
